## ðŸ’¬ **Sample Questions & Responses**

### **Personal Data Queries**
```
Q: "Which appliance is costing me the most?"
A: "Your Air Conditioner is currently your most expensive appliance, costing $45.60 per month (LKR 13,908) and consuming 304 kWh. It accounts for 62% of your total monthly bill."

Q: "Show me my bill history trends"
A: "Looking at your 6 months of data, your average monthly consumption is 180 kWh costing $54.30. You had a spike in December (220 kWh) likely due to increased AC usage during the hot season."

Q: "What are my recent notifications?"
A: "You have 3 unread notifications: 1) High usage alert for yesterday (35% above average), 2) Bill projection warning (exceeding $100 budget), and 3) New energy tip about off-peak usage."
```

### **Tax & Tariff Queries**
```
Q: "Explain the domestic tariff blocks in Sri Lanka"
A: "Sri Lanka uses a progressive tariff system. For your current 180 kWh usage, you pay: 30 kWh at LKR 2.50, 30 kWh at LKR 4.85, 30 kWh at LKR 9.85, 30 kWh at LKR 15.95, and 60 kWh at LKR 27.75, totaling LKR 2,685 before taxes."

Q: "How does VAT affect my bill?"
A: "With your projected monthly bill of LKR 3,200, you'll pay 18% VAT (LKR 576) plus 2.5% social service contribution (LKR 80), adding LKR 656 in taxes to your base consumption cost."

Q: "Should I install solar panels?"
A: "Based on your 180 kWh monthly usage, a 3kW solar system could offset 70% of your consumption. With government subsidies covering 80% of installation costs, you could save LKR 1,800+ monthly after the payback period."
```

### **Optimization Queries**
```
Q: "How can I reduce my highest energy costs?"
A: "Focus on your Air Conditioner (62% of bill). Strategies: 1) Set temperature 2Â°C higher to save LKR 400/month, 2) Use during off-peak hours (10:30 PM - 5:30 AM) for 30% rate reduction, 3) Clean filters monthly for 10% efficiency gain."

Q: "How much can I save with off-peak usage?"
A: "Shifting your washing machine, dishwasher, and water heater to off-peak hours (10:30 PM - 5:30 AM) could save you approximately LKR 300-500 monthly, as off-peak rates are 30% lower than peak rates."
